# VigCypher
The code is a simple application of the Vigenère cipher which explanation can be found on Wikipedia.

This is a really basic script but can be helpful to provide hints on how to structure such problems. 
The functioning is pretty simple, it takes as console input the message you want to encript and the associated key, it then returns the encripted message and the decripted message. Consider the fact that any non-letter character will be kept unaltered as the tabula recta does not account for such characters.
